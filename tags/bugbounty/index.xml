in this blog I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you how I was able to kill/dos any Gitea server I discovered this bug in Gitea version 1.14.2 in 2021
which was fixed in 1.14.3 by the Gitea team Please note that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t targeting Gitea at all, I was doing some bug bounty hunting on a private target That target&amp;rsquo;s staging-dev.target.com has gitea on it
