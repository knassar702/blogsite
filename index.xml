In this blog, we will learn how to manually insert cookies into the Ajax spider browser in Zaproxy without doing an login automation
Why? You cannot automate the logging process because sometimes the target uses Capatch on the login page, but you can log in and copy the cookies into Zap.
You can control every aspect of Zaproxy using its scripting feature
With Selenium&amp;rsquo;s Firefox or Chrome browser plugin, we can write a script that executes JavaScript code whenever the Selenium tab is opened in Zap</description></item><item><title> [IBM] XSS Reflected via xml files</title><link>https://blog.knas.me/blog/ibm_xss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 17:55:28 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.knas.me/blog/ibm_xss/</guid><description>Hello World :wave: while I&amp;rsquo;m doing some bug hunting on IBM subdomains I decided instead of using subdomain enumeration I can get interesting endpoints and parameters from waybackurls to shorten the time, after reading the URLs from waybackurls I noticed a lot of endpoints that contain some URLs of XML files in rssurl parameter

after doing subdomain enumeration I found a subdomain that&amp;rsquo;s working with Joomla, after that I ran joomscan to get the version of the cms and plugins to see if there&amp;rsquo;s any outdated version to exploit it, and joomscan gives me an old plugin called JCK Editor with version 6.</description></item><item><title>How I Solved the intigriti CURL challenge</title><link>https://blog.knas.me/blog/initgriti_curl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 18:32:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.knas.me/blog/initgriti_curl/</guid><description>I woke up this morning to something interesting from Initgrit on Twitter. That&amp;rsquo;s a good challenge for reading files from servers
My fast break is over, so I turn on my computer and start looking at the code they provided

in this blog I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you how I was able to kill/dos any Gitea server I discovered this bug in Gitea version 1.14.2 in 2021
which was fixed in 1.14.3 by the Gitea team Please note that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t targeting Gitea at all, I was doing some bug bounty hunting on a private target That target&amp;rsquo;s staging-dev.target.com has gitea on it
and I thought, &amp;ldquo;Okay, I think there&amp;rsquo;s CVES for that product&amp;rdquo; and yeah I found some but Unfortunately, the POC isn&amp;rsquo;t included in the CVE report (only the PR on github)</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://blog.knas.me/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.knas.me/about/</guid><description>I am passionate about cyber security and programming, There is a lot of information that I have collected about my experiences as a bug bounty hunter in the past, and Iâ€™ve found many security issues in many company products like Sony, Nokia, Gitea, Telekom Germany, Zaproxy, IBM, OPPO, Neon Wordpress Theme Additionally, I enjoy doing some security automation stuff with Python and Rust as a result of this, I have developed some automated tools that are used by bug bounty hunters such as scant3r, Lotus, Lorsrf, pyshell</description></item></channel></rss>
