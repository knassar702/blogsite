### >>  [Scant3r](https://github.com/knassar702/scant3r)
this is a module-based web automation tool that I made for saving my scripting time by providing some utilizes that every web pentester needs in his automation script instead of focusing on ( logger, parsers, output function, cmd args, multi-threading), just write the logic of your scanning idea with scant3r utils without caring about these things, you can find callback/parsing/logging utils and output functions, Also we will add Restful API soon
what if you need to add a new Command option to scant3r for your script?
easy without writing any code just open the `conf/opts.YAML file and you will find all options of scant3r so you can change and add what you want;D
