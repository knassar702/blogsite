### Description

this is a module-based web automation tool that I made for saving my scripting time by providing some utilizes that every web pentester needs in his automation script instead of focusing on ( logger, parsers, output function, cmd args, multi-threading), just write the logic of your scanning idea with scant3r utils without caring about these things, you can find callback/parsing/logging utils and output functions
