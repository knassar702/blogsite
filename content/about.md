I am passionate about cyber security and programming, There is a lot of information that I have collected about my experiences as a bug bounty hunter in the past, and I’ve found many security issues in many company products like Sony, Nokia, Gitea, Telekom Germany, Zaproxy, IBM, OPPO, Neon Wordpress Theme
Additionally, I enjoy doing some security automation stuff with Python and Rust as a result of this, I have developed some automated tools that are used by bug bounty hunters such as scant3r, Lotus, Lorsrf, pyshell

In my role at Blacklock Security, I’m currently working as a security automation engineer and I’m responsible for automating the web security process for our clients, so that they can scan their products and get a simplified report with all the checks they need to change

During my free time, I’m working on a project that I’ve mentioned above (Lotus) which is an open source project to develop an automation system for DAST that is much more intelligent and faster
