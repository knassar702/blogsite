## Introduction to Memory
Before we delve into the explaintion for memory management, let's first address the question: "What exactly is memory?"
In simple terms, memory refers to the essential component within your computer that stores and holds various types of data. 
It can be compared to a vast storage space where live data resides, such as the progress you've made in a game, the text you're typing in a text editor, or even the blog post you're currently reading.

Memory plays a critical role in your computer's performance and functionality. Without it, every time the CPU needs to access or retrieve data, it would have to rely solely on interactions with hardware, resulting in significantly slower performance.

By having memory, the CPU can swiftly access the required data, significantly reducing the time it takes to process information and perform tasks. It acts as a bridge between the CPU and other hardware components, ensuring a smooth and efficient flow of data within your PC.

Now that we have a clear understanding of what memory is and its importance, we can dive deeper into the realm of memory management, where we explore how the Linux Kernel efficiently handles and optimizes this precious resource.



## Memory Addressing
The operating system (OS) is responsible for managing all of the resources on a computer system including The Memory, This was a very complex and time-consuming task for the OS
But the great thing to mention that in these days the microprocessors includes a few hardware features that makes memory management more efficient and robust, like

- [A memory management unit (MMU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit): a hardware component that translates virtual addresses to physical addresses, This capability gives the OS the abalilty to allocate memory to processes without needing to handling itself with physical location of the memory
- [Memory protection](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_protection): This feature ensure that processes cannot access memory that they are not authorized to access, This will be useful for preventing programming errors from causing memory corruption

In this blog we will take Intel 8086 microprocessors as an example to explore memory addressing memory chips and we will see How linux uses the avaible features to handle the memory effectively

commenly programmers refer to memory address as the way to access memory cell content, but when we need to deal with 8086 microprocessors you've to play with with three kind of memory addresses:

- [Logical Address](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_address): it incluides machine code instructions to specify the address of an operand or of an instruction
